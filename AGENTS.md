# Agent Guidance — bambu-history-dump

## Issue hygiene

GitHub Issues are the source of truth for deferred work. At the start of any
session where significant features or refactoring are discussed:

1. **Check GitHub Issues** — scan open issues and mention any directly relevant to
   the current work.
2. **Close completed issues** when the work has already been finished.
3. **Create issues** for clearly useful work that comes up but isn't being done in
   the current session. Keep them concise: background, proposed approach, open
   questions. Don't over-engineer them.

## Architecture overview

```
dump-bambu-history.ts   — CLI: fetch from Bambu API → insert → normalize → download covers
normalize.ts            — Session detection & job upsert (also importable)
api.ts                  — Hono HTTP server entry point
routes/                 — Hono route handlers (jobs, projects, tasks, rates, summary, ui)
models/                 — DB query functions called by routes
lib/
  auto-group.ts         — Auto-group unassigned jobs into projects (by designId or title)
  colors.ts             — ANSI color helpers for CLI/server logs
  constants.ts          — Shared constants (session gap, API limits, timeouts)
  covers.ts             — Local cover image cache (download + serve)
  db.ts                 — Schema, migrations, prepared statements (better-sqlite3)
  fetch.ts              — Bambu API fetch with retry + pagination
  migrations.ts         — Numbered migration helpers and schema_migrations bookkeeping
  normalize.ts          — normalizeTask() — maps raw API shape to PrintTask
  pricing.ts            — Pure pricing functions (no DB access)
  session-detection.ts  — Shared session grouping logic used by normalization
  types.ts              — Shared TypeScript interfaces
  util.ts               — Route/model utility helpers
public/                 — Frontend (Preact + htm, no build step)
  index.html            — Shell HTML (API_KEY injected server-side)
  app.js                — Root component, routing, data fetching
  app.css               — All styles
  components/           — Preact components (atoms, modal, views, toast, router)
covers/                 — Cached cover PNGs (gitignored, populated by sync)
```

### Key data concepts

- **print_task**: one plate from one Bambu API task record. Raw API data stored in `raw_json`.
- **session**: group of plates from the same `(instanceId, deviceId)` printed within 4 hours
  of each other (configurable via `SESSION_GAP_S`). `session_id` = the first task's Bambu API id.
- **job**: one row per session. The unit for pricing and customer tracking.
- **project**: a group of related jobs. Auto-created by `autoGroupProjects` or created manually in the UI.
- **job_filaments**: AMS slot data per task (filament type, color hex, weight used).

### Auto-grouping logic

Jobs are auto-assigned to projects in two passes (see `lib/auto-group.ts`):

1. **MakerWorld designs** — jobs with a real `designId` (not `"0"` or empty) are grouped
   by `designId`. One project per unique design.
2. **User-imported models** — jobs where `designId` is `"0"`, empty, or null (i.e. models
   sliced locally in Bambu Studio, not from MakerWorld). These have no shared design ID,
   so they are grouped by **title prefix**:
   - Bambu Studio names tasks as `{project_name}_plate_{N}` or `{project_name}_{custom_plate_name}`.
   - First pass collects all known `_plate_N` base names.
   - Second pass maps named plates (e.g. `BD-1 - complete_Leg Lower - Right`) back to
     their parent project if the base prefix (before the last `_`) matches a known `_plate_` base.
   - `source_design_id` for title-based projects uses a `title:` prefix to avoid collisions
     with numeric MakerWorld design IDs.

### Pricing rules

- **Per-job pricing**: material + machine + labor (with minimum) + extra labor + markup.
- **Per-project pricing**: aggregates material + machine across all jobs, but applies
  only **one** labor charge (one setup, not per-job). This prevents a multi-plate print
  from being billed N× the labor minimum.
- Only **finished** plates count toward weight and time — failed/cancelled plates are
  excluded as production loss.
- If a job's filament type has no matching `material_rates` row, pricing falls back to PLA.

### DB is synchronous

`better-sqlite3` is synchronous — no `await` needed for DB calls. All query functions
in `models/` are plain sync functions.

## Code quality

```bash
npm run lint         # ESLint (typescript-eslint + eslint-config-prettier)
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix lint issues
npm run format       # Prettier (write)
npm run format:check # Prettier (check only)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # vitest run
```

**Always run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm test` before committing.**
The ESLint config (`eslint.config.js`) uses flat config with `typescript-eslint/recommended`
and defers formatting to Prettier. The `public/` directory is excluded from ESLint (plain
JS, no TypeScript).

Prettier config (`.prettierrc.json`): double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas,
100-char print width, 2-space indent.

## Development workflow

```bash
npm run dev       # Hot-reload API server (tsx watch)
npm run api       # Start API server once
npm run sync      # Fetch from Bambu API + normalize + download covers
npm run normalize # Rebuild sessions/jobs from existing print_tasks
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```

The API requires `API_KEY` env var. Sync requires `BAMBU_TOKEN` (or `~/.bambu_token`).
Set `SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS` on the API server to run sync on startup and then periodically.

## Frontend architecture

The UI uses **Preact 10 + htm** via ESM imports from `https://esm.sh` — no build step,
no bundler. Browser caches modules after first load; requires internet on first load.

- `routes/ui.ts` is a thin server: injects `window.API_KEY` into the HTML shell,
  serves static files from `public/`, provides `/data` and `/covers/:taskId` endpoints.
- Components live in `public/components/` as plain `.js` modules.
- Use `toast()` from `public/components/toast.js` for user feedback — **never use
  `alert()` or `confirm()`** in the frontend.

**Adding new pages / features:**

- Add new components to `public/components/`
- Add new API endpoints in `routes/` and `models/` as needed
- Do NOT add React/Vue/Svelte/Vite — build pipeline overhead isn't worth it

## Cover images

Pre-signed S3 URLs expire 30 minutes after sync. `lib/covers.ts` downloads them
to `covers/{task_id}.png` during sync. Tasks not returned by the API (beyond the
fetch window) will have expired URLs — those covers are permanently unavailable
unless you increase `BAMBU_LIMIT` to capture them before expiry.

## Commit conventions

Use atomic commits with conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
`refactor:`, `perf:`). Never `git add -A` — stage only files related to the change.
